        <h3>Description</h3>
        My love for oats has grown over time. Initially non-existent in my diet, oatmeal is now a daily staple for me. A cold morning may call for a warm bowl of oatmeal, but 99% of the year i'm consuming them as overnight oats. The extended time, minimum 8 hours, oats spend with the ingredients lends to a more pudding-like texture that is achieved. Once they're pulled from the refridgerator, all that's missing is adding the toppings and flavor enhancers I preferre that day. Here is my favorite version.
